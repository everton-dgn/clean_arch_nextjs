# :memo: About the Project

This application is a boilerplate for complex and large systems, especially those that need to scale with security and code quality, following the principles of Clean Architecture.

We sought to achieve three pillars: readability, reusability, and refactorability.

For the UI construction, the Atomic Design structure was chosen, organizing global components into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates.

In addition to being constantly updated, this project was meticulously configured to serve as a foundation for professional projects that require a standardized, maintainable, and scalable code architecture and design.
