# assets

The **assets** folder contains **static files** that are used throughout the application, such as **images, icons, fonts, and stylesheets**.

Only **assets meant to be imported as components** (e.g., SVGs as React components) should be placed here.

All other images, videos, and static files should be placed in the **public** folder to be accessed.

## Example

```plaintext
📁 assets
 ├── 📁 images
 │    ├── logo.svg
 │    ├── background.svg
 ├── 📁 icons
 │    ├── check.svg
 │    ├── close.svg
```
