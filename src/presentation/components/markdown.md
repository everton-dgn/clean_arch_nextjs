# components

The **components** folder is structured following the **Atomic Design** methodology, which organizes UI components into hierarchical layers to ensure **scalability and reusability**.

## Subdirectories

- **`atoms`**: The smallest and most fundamental UI elements.
- **`molecules`**: Combinations of atoms forming more complex components.
- **`organisms`**: Groups of molecules that create meaningful UI sections.
- **`providers`**: Any global application of the application/libs.
- **`templates`**: Layout structures that define page compositions.
